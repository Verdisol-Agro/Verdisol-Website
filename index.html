              <h3>Scientific Land-Use & Management Planning</h3>
              <p>
                We transform your farm into a blueprint for success.
                Using drone mapping, soil analysis, and spatial planning,
                our team develops comprehensive land-use plans that maximize every hectare’s potential.<br>
                From field layout and irrigation design to crop zoning and infrastructure placement,
                every decision is guided by science — ensuring higher yields, lower waste, and sustainable land stewardship.

              <h3>Drone-Based Underground Water Surveys</h3>
              <p>
                Eliminate the guesswork and find water with precision.
                Our drone-powered geophysical surveys use advanced sensors
                to detect underground water sources and aquifer patterns before drilling begins.
                This technology minimizes costly trial-and-error drilling, providing reliable
                data that ensures your investment in boreholes and irrigation systems is well-informed and efficient.

                VerdiSol Agro partners with local authorities, NGOs, and investors to design and implement sustainable rural development models.
                From agricultural zoning and resource mapping to infrastructure planning and training, we help build thriving, self-sustaining rural ecosystems powered by smart technology and community engagement.

    <h2>Most Asked Questions</h2>
    <div class="faq-container">
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How do drone surveys find underground water?</h3>
        <p>Our drones use sensors that detect variations in soil and subsurface conductivity, helping locate aquifers precisely.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do you offer services outside Zimbabwe?</h3>
        <p>Yes, Verdisol operates regionally across Southern Africa, adapting technology to local terrains and climate zones.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can small-scale farmers afford your drone services?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely. We design scalable packages that fit budgets from individual farms to large cooperatives.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What is the accuracy of your drone-based underground water survey?</h3>
        <p>Our drone-based water survey delivers an accuracy rate of up to 80%. We provide multiple detection points across your land rather than relying on a single reading, ensuring higher precision. The survey covers the entire property, analyzing geological structures, rock formations, and underground fractures to pinpoint potential water-bearing zones. <br>
        By combining aerial mapping, geophysical sensors, and advanced data analysis, we identify the most promising borehole sites with minimal environmental disturbance. This approach helps reduce drilling costs and increase the likelihood of successful water discovery.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do you provide a report after the survey?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes, we do. Each survey includes a comprehensive report featuring a stream analysis map and a water table map. These maps can also be used for farm land-use planning and development. Your full report is delivered within 48 hours from the date of the survey.
